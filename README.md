## TYMER

TYMER is a REACT web application that enables you to set a time limit for your tasks and also for your breaks inbetween. In addition, there is also a tasklist functionality where you can keep track of your current and upcoming tasks which are saved locally in your browser.

## Motive

I created this web application just for learning purposes and to get more familiar with web development and the REACT framework.
